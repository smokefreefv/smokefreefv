## Testimony from Neighbors about Second-Hand Smoke

The quotes below are testmony from our Fairlington Villages neighbors who have dealt with second-hand smoke. Most of these are sourced from the Fairlington Villages Quality of Life Survey in late 2023.

- "There was a chain smoker that lived next door to me for nearly 3 years. The stench was unbearable and would come into my unit and back patio. You could smell it from the sidewalk. When the home was sold and remodeled, the new owner had to gut the unit with new drywall and staircase because the smoke was absorbed into the walls and wood. This smoke affected the entire building and because the prior owner was a heavy drinker, the potential for fire damage was high risk."
- "I spent thousands of dollars when I was remodeling my kitchen to have the walls patched and painted with Kilz to eliminate the smoke smell from my neighbor. I ended up needing to have them do the same in the upstairs bathroom too. She just moved out, and I’m hoping the owner won’t rent to another smoker."
- "Our upstairs neighbor smokes on the balcony and it will seep through our bathroom vent and into our home. It's disgusting."
- "I live on the 3rd floor. If someone smokes inside, it carries throughout the building and impacts my living space. I choose not to smoke, I should not have the impact of those who choose to smoke."
- "This is a huge issue in the condos! The neighbors that smoked were approached multiple times in person, personal notes and via FB Management. The smokers where was to keep it outside as other resistances had children or were battling cancer or had pet that it was impacting and they ignored all forms of pleas. The whole building smelled, adjacent units smelled. It was horrible and there was nothing anyone could do about it. I know it also impacted other owners ability to sell because of the smell."
- "Not having a smoking ban lost us a contract on our condo when we tried to sell it. The buyers eventually bought in a condo that had a smoking ban. We have had to close windows and deal with the smell of smoke through our kitchen in the past. It is frustrating and disgusting and is now hurting our property sales. A ban is the most efficient measure as those that want to use smoking products can choose patches and edibles that do not effect the health of those around them."
- "A neighbor who frequently smokes for long periods of time outdoors every day makes my backyard an unpleasant place for my family, including my young children. I would like for smoking to be banned, both indoors and outdoors."
- "The marijuana smoke is awful. I am tired of my kid playing outside being exposed to marijuana smoke."
- "I have asthma so my neighbors weed smoking greatly affects me even with 3 Dyson air filters in our home."
- "I am very sensitive to cigarette smoke which triggers headaches. I live in a multi-unit building. If someone moved in who smoked, it would be intolerable."
- "I'm highly allergic to smoking. I had to move out of my last unit because a neighbor smoked. I'm lucky enough that no one in my immediate building smokes, but I strongly support banning, as sometimes their guests do."
- "It is very hard to mitigate the odor from smoking and especially from marijuana in multiunit buildings. There was a marijuana smoker in my building for several years and there was little I could do to keep the smell out of my unit despite three air purifiers. It permeated the shared stairwell and often came through the shared kitchen wall. I would absolutely be in favor of banning smoking of all kinds, particularly in multiunit buildings."
- "There's a certain area of the neighborhood where I walk and every time I walk by it reeks of cigarette smoke, I imagine it must be awful for the non-smokers who live there. It's bad enough just walking by as the smoke smell lingers permanently.
- "Bothered by smoke when we have our door/window open and smokes drifts down from upper balcony."
- "The fear of a smoker moving in nextdoor was my only hesitation about buying in Fairlington. Second hand smoke causes lung cancer, can seep through the walls, and ruins the use of outdoor space. Please, please, please prohibit smoking in Fairlington."
