## Summary

Second-hand smoke jeopardizes the health, safety, and comfort of residents in our community. We are residents of Fairlington Villages requesting that the Fairlington Villages Board of Directors enact a policy that prohibits smoking within all units, patios, balconies, and common areas.

## How to Support

You can work toward a smoke-free Fairlington Villages by doing the following:

- Sign the petition. An online petition is available here. This will be regularly provided to board members to show support for the cause.
- Speak at a Fairlington Villages board meeting in support of a smoking ban. Check the [Fairlington Villages homepage](https://fairlingtonvillages.com/) for the meeting schedule, but they are typically once a month on Wednesdays.
- Email board members and express your support of a smoking ban. We'd recommend at least contacting the board member for your ward as well as the at-large board members. If you're not sure which ward you're in, [view this ward map](images/ward-map.png) and see the list below.

## Questions and Answers

**Wow, a smoking ban? Isn't that a bit harsh?**  
It's the only way to ensure that residents of Fairlington Villages can enjoy their homes and yards without second-hand smoke.

**Is a smoking ban even possible?**  
Yes. In 2021, Virginia passed a law allowing a simple majority of any condo board to prohibit smoking within units and in common areas. It was codified as [ยง 55.1-1960.1](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title55.1/chapter19/section55.1-1960.1/).

**We shouldn't tell people what to do in their own homes.**  
When Fairlington residents smoke, it is not just a personal decision. Smoking affects their neighbors too. All of our units share at least one wall with a neighbor. Our walls, floors and ceilings are a very poor barrier for smoke or smoking odors. One resident exercising their "right" to smoke jeopardizes their neighbors' right to clean air.

**What if we just banned smoking outdoors, and continued to allow residents to smoke in their own units?**  
That would probably cause individuals who currently smoke outdoors to smoke indoors, which would be far more uncomfortable for their immediate neighbors. It would also increase the risk of house fires.

**I've never smelled smoke in my unit or yard, so why should I care?**  
The only way to keep it that way is to put a smoking ban in place. Otherwise, a smoker could move in next to you at any time.

**I've never even heard of anyone having an issue with smoking in Fairlington.**  
It's a common complaint among residents here. It's often mentioned in the Fairlington Villages newsletter.

**I don't care if a smoker moves next to me. The smell doesn't bother me.**  
Most people do, including homebuyers. Homes that smell like smoke sell for much less. A homebuyer recently reneged on a contingent home purchase due to Fairlington Villages' lack of a no-smoking policy. Our neighbors with asthma also care a great deal.

**What's next, a ban on barbecue? A ban on strong-smelling food?**  
The Virginia statute creates a simple process for a ban on smoking. If people have good-faith issues with other odors or habits, it's a separate conversation and a separate process that is irrelevant to this issue. Creating a "slippery slope" hypothetical is a failure to engage in the matter at hand.

**What about vaping?**  
Vaping isn't covered by the Virginia statute, so a proposed smoking ban would not affect vaping.

**What would all of the smokers do once a smoking ban is in place?**  
Cigarette smokers can chew nicotine gum or use nicotine patches. Cannabis smokers can consume edibles.

**Is this fair to people who bought units expecting that they would be able to smoke?**  
Smoking in perpetuity in and around one's home was never guaranteed. Cultural norms have changed. We tolerate smoking in a lot fewer places than we used to, which nearly everyone would say is an improvement. People can now expect smoke-free air at a mall or restaurant. The same should be true in our homes and yards.

**Has any other local condo association implemented a ban like this?**  
Yes, including several in Arlington. None have yet done so in Fairlington.

**How would we handle enforcement?**  
Enforcement practices would be hashed out in a smoking policy which would formalize the smoking ban. We are learning about enforcement practices from local condo associations who have already banned smoking. By their accounts, their efforts have been successful.

**We will never convince enough people to make this happen.**  
Only a majority of the Fairlington Villages board -- five out of nine board members -- need to agree in order to approve a smoking ban. Some of them are already inclined to support a ban.

Thank you for your support.
